## Description

FOr this project I needed to create a feedback website for students. The website should have 5 pages, each that links to the next. First 3 will take in a numerical value that corresponds with how a student is feeling in general, how well they are understanding the material, and how well supported they feel by staff. The 4th page will be a comments sections where they can free text and comments, or leave it blank. The last page the student will be able to see all of the info they have entered and then click submit. 

When submit is clicked it sends the data via redux to a database where it is stored. The student will also be directed to a final page that states that the survey is complete with the option to start a new one.
